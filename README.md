30thAnniversarySite
===================

2005 site, using .shtml, Widener Law School  celebrating the 30th Anniversary of its first graduating class.

Notes:
--------------------
Although this is an older site, I have uploaded it to show some older .shtml projects. Most of my current projects are built on WordPress. You can see [my portfolio here] (http://www.workandplay.net)
